# Covisu_Growth-Ring-Map
Growth Ring Map code created in COVISU Project


Download the content of the github repository.
Launch a local server on the downloaded repository (using Python SimpleHTTPServer or else).
Launch the application on a browser. 
Upload a dataset (a sample dataset is provided in the "data" folder. If you want to use your own data, you have to generate a dataset following the same model of the provided sample dataset).
Use the app to explore your data. All the parameters regarding the construction of the glyphs can be adjusted on the left of the screen. The parameters regarding the construction of the color scale can be adjusted through a legend menu, that you can access/close by pressing on the "Legend" button.
(note: be carefull using the sliders for the color scale creation: the conflicts between different sliders' values are not managed for now).
Feel free to contact me if you have any question for using the app.
